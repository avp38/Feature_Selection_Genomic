ctypes 1.0.1 released - October 20, 2006
========================================

Overview

    ctypes is an advanced ffi (Foreign Function Interface) package for
    Python 2.3 and higher.

    ctypes allows to call functions exposed from dlls/shared libraries
    and has extensive facilities to create, access and manipulate
    simple and complicated C data types in Python - in other words:
    wrap libraries in pure Python.  It is even possible to implement C
    callback functions in pure Python.

    ctypes runs on Windows, Windows CE, MacOS X, Linux, Solaris,
    FreeBSD, OpenBSD. It may also run on other systems, provided that
    libffi supports this platform.


Changes in 1.0.1

    If the Python part of a ctypes callback function returns None, and
    this cannot be converted to the required C type, an exception is
    printed with PyErr_WriteUnraisable.  Before this change, the C
    callback returned arbitrary values to the calling code.
	
    The __repr__ method of a NULL ctypes.py_object() no longer raises
    an exception.

    This release contains exactly the same code as the ctypes package
    included in Python 2.5.

Changes in 1.0.0

    Better support for comtypes.  More target platforms for OpenBSD.
    Several small bugfixes.

    This is exactly the same version as included in Python 2.5b3.
