# Feature_Selection_Genomic

Feature Selection Algorithm for Classification (Feature Engg.)

Project description

• Developed machine learning model for classifying large simulated genomic dataset containing about 30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (sample size - 10000; feature dimension - 32768)

• The proposed model was developed using mRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) algorithm, multiple feature extraction and RBF-SVM classifier

• Achieved a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 67.11% and a test accuracy of 66.72% with only 10 features, outperforming other feature selection and learning based methods
